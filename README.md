Spam-Classifier
===============

Programming Exercise 6 in Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.  In this exercise one shall learn to use support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier.

The course info can be found here https://class.coursera.org/ml-004/class/index
The details of this assignment is described in ex5.pdf

The codes are written by Octave.
